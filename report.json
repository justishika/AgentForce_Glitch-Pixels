    "Liability": {
      "status": "COMPLIANT",
      "reason": "Yes.\n\nThis section addresses the checklist item by limiting liability to a specified cap of $10,000, which meets the requirement of having a specified cap. However, it does not explicitly clarify the types of damages excluded, such as consequential damages. Despite this, the section does provide some limitation on liability, which is the primary requirement of the checklist item. A more comprehensive approach would be to explicitly exclude certain types of damages, but the provided section still partially addresses the checklist item.",

    "Termination": {
      "status": "COMPLIANT",
      "reason": "Yes.\n\nThis section addresses the checklist item because it allows either party to terminate the Agreement with 60 days' written notice, which implies termination for convenience. The notice period is also specified as 60 days, meeting the requirement. Although the section does not explicitly mention termination \"for cause,\" it does provide for termination with notice, which aligns with the checklist item's requirement for termination for convenience with a specified notice period.",
